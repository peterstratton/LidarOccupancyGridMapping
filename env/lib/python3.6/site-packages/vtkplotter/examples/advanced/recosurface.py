"""
Example to show how to use recoSurface()
to reconstruct a surface from points.

 1. An object is loaded and
    noise is added to its vertices.
 2. the point cloud is smoothened with MLS
    (see moving_least_squares.py)
 3. mesh.clean() imposes a minimum distance
    among mesh points where 'tol' is the
    fraction of the mesh size.
 4. a triangular mesh is extracted from
    this set of sparse Points, 'bins' is the
    number of voxels of the subdivision
