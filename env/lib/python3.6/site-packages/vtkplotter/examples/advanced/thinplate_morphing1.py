"""Thin Plate Spline transformations describe a nonlinear warp
transform defined by a set of source and target landmarks.
Any point on the mesh close to a source landmark will
be moved to a place close to the corresponding target landmark.
The points in between are interpolated using Bookstein's algorithm.
